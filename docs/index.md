# Recurring Shopping API

The Recurring Shopping API enables users to create and manage lists of products they frequently buy throughout the year.

Administrators can manage users or allow users to subscribe or unsubscribe with a minimum of oversight.

Need help? This service has extensive [user documentation].

**NOTE:** This is a mock API to simulate the REST interface of an imaginary service.

## Quickstart

Get started with the following tutorials:

* System setup
* Creating a user
* Adding a new list item

## API Reference

Detailed descriptions of the service's resources. The `products` and `users` resources support get, update, patch, delete, and search.

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service.

When running a local test, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`.

* [Users resource](./user/users.md)
* [Products resource](./product/products.md)
